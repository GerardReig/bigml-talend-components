## TOS-Components

BigML.io is a REST-style API for creating and managing BigML resources programmatically. Using BigML.io you can create, retrieve, update and delete Sources, Datasets, Models, Ensembles, Clusters, Predictions, Centroids, Batch Predictions, Batch Centroids, and Evaluations using standard HTTP methods. 

In this repository you'll find all the TOS components that you can use in your job designs to interact with all the BigML.io services - The BigML API.

Each component has its own directory and its own maven project. 

For now, the available componentes are:

* **tBigMLPredict**: allows real-time predictions. You can send your input fields and get in return the prediction and its confidence degree.
